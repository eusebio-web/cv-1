  <h2>Work experience</h2>
  <em><strong>1983-1991: Mechanical Engineering Industrial Trainee:</strong></em>
  <p>Project Development Institute (PRODA), Iva Valley Enugu. I was part of a team that designed an industrial Garri-food processing plant. I also participated on teams responsible for the design of a range of small industrial processing units,
    including palm oil processing, cashew nut roasting, producing yam and cassava flour, and rice milling. Anambra State Motor Manufacturing Company (ANAMCO) Nike-Enugu. I attended Industrial Training in aspects of Mechanical Engineering with
    emphasis on welding, fluid circuitry and actuation, use of bench tools, lathe machinery and drilling tools. I also had a primary responsibility of working and managing Mercedes Truck & Vehicle Assembly lines. West African Glass Industry (WAGI)
    Port Harcourt. During a period of Industrial Training at WAGI, I designed and constructed a glass washing machine for feeds to an Industrial Glass Furnace. Imperial College Rolls Royce Research Centre, Exhibition Road, London SW7 2AZ, UK. I
    worked as a Lab Windows Programmer. My employment was to develop human-computer interaction (HCI) front-end software for real-time monitoring of Audi Vehicle Brake-Testing Rig.</p>
  <em><strong>1993-1998: Senior Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) Engineer:</strong></em>
  <p>T&N Technology (Ferodo Group), Rugby, Warwickshire, West Midlands, UK. My responsibilities included performance of Noise, Vibration & Harshness (NVH) development of Aero-Engine and Automotive components and development of an Automated Brake
    System Noise Testing Rig to reconciled Brake Noise Performance with Braking Parameters. I also introduced Modal Testing applications to T&N Technology, and was responsible for the procurement of the relevant range of equipment for such vibration
    engineering. Lotus Cars & Engineering, Hethel, Norfolk, UK. At Lotus Engineering my job was Project Leader for NVH Vehicle Development assignments. In this period I introduced Modal Testing technology to Lotus, and applied this to efficient
    vehicle development assignments. The assignments included developing Air Bag Sensing devices for the Bugatti EB110, developing the Rolls Royce Engine sub frame, developing rear sub-frame for Ford and Jaguar vehicles. At Lotus, I was subcontracted
    for a 6 month to Los Angeles California for the NVH development of a saloon car for a Daewoo US Market Vehicle.</p>

  <h2>Research interests</h2>
  <em><strong>Synopsis:</strong></em>
  <p>The focus of my current research is in the multi-disciplinary integration of typically intercollegiate emerging technologies with industrial related applications. My background in Mechanical Engineering, with specialist postgraduate and
    postdoctoral proficiency in Noise, Vibration, and Harshness Engineering has given me a solid numerate background to investigate the wide range of physical behaviours of individual components and complex system. A typical example would be the
    specific re-design of the housing for the air-bag deployment sensor in a Bugatti EB110 supercar, and on the other hand the complete development of a new motor-vehicle for Daewoo to target the USA market. Such vehicle development can similarly be
    applied to the design, development and build of High Speed Railway vehicles, railway tracks, and foundations for noise, vibration, and harshness. My solid background in engineering enables me reconcile results from theoretical models with
    practical measurements on physical systems.</p>
  <p>My postgraduate studies on Geographical Information Management (GIS) gave me the skills to integrate technological information applicable to individual components with those applicable to groups of components forming complex systems. Geography
    for instance enables the traversal from local scales to global scales, traversing from say a building information model (BIM) to a precinct information model (PIM). Such concepts are pertinent in integrating systems. When a complex system like a
    railway network is put to use in an urban setting, the sustainability of such a system is impinged on by the integration of relevant technologies. My second PhD research developed a framework for the analytics of big-data from consumers of
    digital services. The veracity of such big-data facilitates identifying the relationship between drivers of mobility choice, passenger behaviour on the railway network (at individual, local, and global scales), socio-demography, and urban
    morphology. This also enables relationships to be established between operational in-service issues like crowding in trains, delays, scheduling, and design issues like structural vehicle noise, vibration, and ride resulting from component design
    and integration. Efficiencies are uncovered by BIM concepts which link all disciplines involved over time in project planning, designs, operation and management, and end-of-life. These apply to the whole-life-cycle costs and sustainability of the
    infrastructure.</p>
  <p>At this stage of my career I am interested in developing technology tools useful to operators of mobility (railways, etc.) networks for the management, maintenance and interventions assessment. I am interested in the application of emerging
    engineering technologies to the design and development of automobiles and high speed railway vehicles. I am interested in the application of philosophies of GIS and BIM, enabling the traversal from small scale to large scale, integrating multiple
    disciplines in a project across time-scales. My broad academic and working experience facilitates the application of my research to a wide range of physical scenarios. I could function at the height of proficiency in related fields of
    engineering, transportation, logistics, environmental sciences, social sciences, big-data analytics, and computing.</p>
